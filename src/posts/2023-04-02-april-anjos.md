We spent today cleaning up our garden and planting some seeds that Susana kindly gave us last weekend — tomatoes, butternut squash and zucchini — as well as some wildflowers and cat grass. The cat that regularly visits us watched us intently as we worked. Later in the after, two new cats visited to investigate the changes too. We must be doing something right.

We've worked out (also thanks to Susana) that the yellow fruit is a [loquat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loquat) (*nêspera* is Portuguses). They taste very sweet and slightly like apricot. H picked some and made them into a jam — two parts loquat to one part sugar and one part water, with lemon juice, cayenne pepper and rosemary.

We also planted basil, mint, coriander, parsley and thyme in pots to sit on our kitchen bench.

I love my riso-printed calendar by [Lauren Doughty](https://laurendoughty.com/). Happy April!
