I recently did a remote lecture for the [Transformation Design](https://www.hbk-bs.de/en/studiengaenge/transformation-design/) course at HBK Braunschweig.

The students are currently doing a subject on *operating systems*, looking at the frameworks and structures that surround design: alternative, established and experimental ways of working, cooperation, organisation and solidarity.

It made me so happy that this course exists! I spoke about my own practice as a digital designer, the different studios I've worked for, collectives I'm part of and the different tools, structures and processes that I've learnt about and found useful in my work.

I also went on for quite a while about how great I think worker cooperatives are — planning to write this bit up in a bit more detail soon.
