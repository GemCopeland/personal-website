I learn more with each weaving I make.

This one is particular favourite of mine, made last month for H’s mum. It’s inspired by the colours and textures of the Welsh landscape: green hills, purple and red heather, mountains, lichen. I bought some roving from a local shop in Dolgellau – it’s incredibly soft, hand-dyed in purple, green and yellow. I also found some wool on our hike and added that in as clouds.

My first weaving, made for Lizzie and Paul in Melbourne using my new loom from [Wunder Weave](https://wunderweave.bigcartel.com/). I experimented with making shapes, adding [rya knots](https://www.theweavingloom.com/weaving-tips-rya-knots/) and [soumak weaving](https://www.theweavingloom.com/weaving-techniques-the-soumak-weave-braid-weave/). Hung on a piece of driftwood found on Minjerribah.

A simpler composition for Nik and Grace in Melbourne. I played with blending similar colours and adding texture through different thicknesses.

A colourful one for Hannah’s birthday, using hand-dyed pastel wool from [The Wool Kitchen](https://www.thewoolkitchen.com/) in London. This was incredible to work with – the patterns of colourful specks gradually emerge in the process. I felt more confident about blending shapes with this one.

![On the left is the finished piece: pastel purple and pink with grey, green, grape and pink. On the right are two work in progress images.](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/17794178/original_356a890addd0ffe0bf12284418ff3512.jpg?1661781112?bc=0)

One for Piper and Sam. With this one I was playing with subtle colour changes again, as well as trying a narrower overall shape. I found the branch on Ilkley moor when we were there to visit them. Really loved the intertwined sections.

I used the same green thread for the weft as is throughout the warp. I really like how you can see coming through, particularly with the thicker wool. 

I was a bit disappointed that it’s drawn in at the middle where I’ve only used really fine wool. It’s hard to know that this is happening when it’s on the loom, but I'm going to be more conscious of not pulling the thread too tight next time.

![This weaving is narrow, made of light and dark green, beige and brown-grey wool.](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/17794176/original_65bc0ac960a61230c4f78edcf477dbf1.jpg?1661781112?bc=0)

Next I want to experiment with making smaller weavings, like [these](https://www.instagram.com/p/ChjGBIsrJRb/). I also want to try one with much more texture, potentially by layering rya knots and loops.
