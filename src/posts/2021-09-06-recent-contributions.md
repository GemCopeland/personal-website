A few recent contributions to various publications:

## Caps Lock

I spoke to Ruben Pater about Common Knowledge for [Caps Lock](http://www.valiz.nl/en/publications/caps-lock.html), his new book about graphic design and capitalism. The interview was mainly centred on how Common Knowledge works on a practical level, both internally and in collaboration with others. Ruben's done such a great job with the book, I'm really proud to be involved and glad that a book like this exists! It's so important to demonstrate alternatives to traditional design practice, and I think he does a good job of making it super accessible.

## Thereâ€™s More Than One Way to Share Your Design Work

I wrote a short explanation of the design of this very website (meta!) for an [AIGA](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/theres-more-than-one-way-to-share-your-work/) article about alternative approaches to design portfolios.

## How to Run a Design Sprint

I gave a very brief explanation of the Google design sprint methodology for [Stir To Action's summer issue](https://www.stirtoaction.com/magazine), with examples of how we used it in collaboration with [Cooperation Town.](https://cooperation.town/)
