We made a last minute decision to spend a month on La Gomera, one of the Canary Islands. After six months of rarely travelling outside north London, it feels surreal to be in such a different environment*. 

The island is small, roughly circular and very mountainous. This weekend we went for a hike in Garajonay National Park, which was such a contrast to the valley where we're staying. 

The mountains catch the clouds blown in by the trade winds, which means the centre is covered in subtropical forest, called [laurisilva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_forest). This is the largest remnant of the type of forest that once covered much of Europe and North Africa. It's quite amazing to wander throughâ€¦ the trees are dripping with lichen and water droplets.

*This is also the closest you can get to the [antipodes](https://www.geodatos.net/en/antipodes/australia/brisbane) of Queensland, so I feel right at home.
