This week I’m thinking a lot about Braiding Sweetgrass, because the forest floor is now covered in purple and yellow flowers (ground ivy and yellow anenome, I think).

![A forest in Lithuania with purple and yellow flowers everywhere. In the background is tree covered in moss and lichen.](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/11726744/original_cf802ce1f5a39dbc883b42bfc44b8dae.jpg?1619361996?bc=0)

> That September pairing of purple and gold is lived reciprocity; its wisdom is that the beauty of one is illuminated by the radiance of the other. Science and art, matter and spirit, indigenous knowledge and Western science—can they be goldenrod and asters for each other? When I am in their presence, their beauty asks me for reciprocity, to be the complementary color, to make something beautiful in response.

I really liked the book's focus on reciprocity as a core principle of nature and means of collaborative survival and much else besides.

> How do we refill the empty bowl? Is gratitude alone enough? Berries teach us otherwise. […] They remind us that all flourishing is mutual. We need the berries and the berries need us. Their gifts multiply by our care for them, and dwindle from our neglect. We are bound in a covenant of reciprocity, a pact of mutual responsibility to sustain those who sustain us.
