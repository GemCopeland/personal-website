How and I went for a hike in [Snowdonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowdonia) last weekend. Almost 40km of walking over two days. Over the last few months we've gradually been collecting all the basic kit you need for multiday hikes: tent, sleeping mats and bags, backpacks, this incredibly compact [wood stove](https://alpkit.com/products/wood-stove-wood-burning-camping-stove). 

It was such an incredible hike. The weather was unusually warm and sunny – I just read that Snowdonia is one of the wettest parts of the UK, so it really *was* unusual. On the first day, we could see out to the ocean for most of the hike. We swam in a pool fed by a waterfall, walked through ferns and forests and across heather-covered hills. There was a tough bit when [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/) decided to take us across a difficult field without a real path, but we managed to find our way back again.

We camped by a lake (Llyn Du) on [Rhinog Fawr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinog_Fawr). I took these three photos about an hour apart around sunset. Entranced by the changes in light over such a short time.

![The same lake, closer. It's a bit darker now and the lake is reflecting the orange of the sunset and rocks above.](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/17562250/original_c8f28d98a4ff6c5ac8a1c8933cbbcda8.jpg?1660152823?bc=0)

![Now you can barely see the lake. The sky is soft blue and pink, which makes the heather in the foreground seem even more purple.](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/17562249/original_ca048b330eb807b7d37b58e9dac0823c.jpg?1660152823?bc=0)
