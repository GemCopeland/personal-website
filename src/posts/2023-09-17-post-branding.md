Very excited to read [*What is post-branding? How to Counter Fundamentalist Marketplace Semiotics*](https://www.setmargins.press/books/what-is-post-branding/), a book by Jason Grant & Oliver Vodeb published by Set Margins (which seems to be publishing all the good design books these days).

> Post-Branding empowers better design of public communication for civic and activist groups by replacing corporate brandingâ€™s predatory principles with a new set of strategies embedded in a new culture of craft. A new way of being and knowing, for a new way of relating with the world.

Jason is runs the Brisbane-based studio [Inkahoots](https://www.inkahoots.com.au/). For the last 30 years or so they've worked in direct collaboration with social movements, transforming from a community-run screenprinting workshop into a non-hierarchical design studio focused on creative political expression.

Jason was one of my tutors at the Queensland College of Art. At the time I was in my final year at uni, about to graduate into a recession, and seriously questioning my choice to become a designer and design's complicity in consumerism. Learning from him and about his practice had a huge influence on me. It prompted me to do a masters of Design Futures with [Tony Fry](https://www.thestudioattheedgeoftheworld.com/people.html) and to try to find ways to be a designer outside of / against capitalism.

On a related note, I've been thinking about writing a series on design and design-adjacent practices that inspire me. My shortlist so far is:
- [Inkahoots](https://www.inkahoots.com.au/) (AU)
- [Holon](https://www.holon.cat/en/#about) (ES)
- [Then Try This](https://thentrythis.org/) (UK)
- [Geeks for Social Change](https://gfsc.studio/) (UK)
- [Promising Trouble](https://www.promisingtrouble.net/) (UK)
- [Krater](https://www.krater.si/en) (SI)
- [Brave New Alps](https://brave-new-alps.com/) (IT)
- [Multitudes](https://multitudes.coop/) (UK)
- [And Also Too](https://www.andalsotoo.net/) (CA)
- [Civic Square](https://civicsquare.cc/) (UK)
