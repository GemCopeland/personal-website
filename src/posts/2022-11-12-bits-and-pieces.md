I’ve been enjoying listening to [Overthink](https://www.overthinkpodcast.com/), a podcast about philosophy. Really engaging and accessible. One of the hosts, Ellie Anderson, is an expert in feminist approaches to love and sexual consent, particularly the work of Simone de Beauvoir. I really want to read some of Beauvoir’s journals now.

Wonderful [conversation between Elvia Wilk and Claire Evans](https://pioneerworks.org/broadcast/elvia-wilk-claire-evans-in-conversation) on Pioneer Works.

> I’m always extremely suspicious, for that reason, of any technology marketed using even remotely utopian language—specifically claims that some new sphere or realm is going to be a fresh start or an unspoiled new beginning. That signals to me immediately that the people who are involved in building the thing have no interest in maintenance.

One of my [posts](https://gemmacope.land/writing/unravel-from-toxic-individualism/) got a mention in a Space10 article [*Where Ideas Come From*](https://space10.com/where-ideas-come-from/), thanks to [Linsey](https://www.linseyrendell.com/). In *very* good company alongside favourites like Brian Eno, The Bloomsbury Group and Donna Haraway. I didn’t realise that this quote originated from indigenous activists in 1970’s Queensland / [Lilla Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilla_Watson):

> If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.

Great episode by [Maria Somerville on the NTS Early Bird Show](https://www.nts.live/shows/early-bird-show-maria-somerville/episodes/early-bird-show-maria-somerville-8th-november-2022). This week she was joined by Róisín Berkeley, who also lives on the west coast of Ireland and has a similarly soothing accent.

Via [Right to Roam](https://www.righttoroam.org.uk/) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Right_2Roam/status/1584291551391670273/) (RIP) I learned that our continued access to Epping Forest was made possible thanks to people protesting its enclosure in the 19th century.

![An illustration of Epping Forest in the 19th century. People are walking and sitting in groups, and the trees look enormous. The caption says "A view in EppingForest"](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/18950097/original_802c07bf33959979e9ea07354cd60039.jpg?1668251471?bc=0)

I don’t pay enough attention to interesting websites anymore, but this one for [Nosaj Thing](https://nosajthing.com/) by Eric Hu and Bureau Cool really stood out thanks to a combination of Eric’s distinctive typography / art direction and the fact that all the images are generated by Stable Diffusion.
