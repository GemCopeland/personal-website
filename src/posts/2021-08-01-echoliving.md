I visited [Echo Living](https://www.echoliving.co.uk/) in Dumfries, Scotland. Very cool seeing how a single material, high-grade CLT, can be used for so much with very little tooling to build rugged, sustainable and well throughout cabins. Thank you [Lurrie](https://laurenceveitch.com/) for hosting me, and Maggie and Sam for your hospitality.
