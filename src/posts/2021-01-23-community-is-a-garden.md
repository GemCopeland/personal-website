I came across [this toolkit](https://www.are.na/block/9400568) when searching for examples of community-led design practices for a workshop that [Sonia](http://soniaturcotte.com/) and I are currently running (more on that soon).

It explores how artists and communities can work together towards climate justice. It has a few interviews and case studies, accompanied by a few prompts and reflective exercises centred around building collaborative relationships and spaces for dialogue.

I really liked the list of practices at the end, particularly *Ambiguity*:
> Moments of disorientation create space for unpredictable discovery. How can you chal- lenge existing narratives, leave questions unanswered, and introduce new lines of inquiry? Through open-ended practice, how can you create conditions that scaffold com- munal discovery? How can you begin with questions rather than answers?

It references a few of my favourite writers, adrienne maree brown and Donna Haraway, and has prompted me to finally read [Braiding Sweetgrass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braiding_Sweetgrass), which I've wanted to do for a while.

I'm collecting more example of [Community-Led Design Practices](https://www.are.na/gemma-copeland/community-led-design-practices) on Arena.
