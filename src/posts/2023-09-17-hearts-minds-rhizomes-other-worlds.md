#### Mobilising Hearts and Minds
I'm just about to start the [Mobilising Hearts and Minds](https://reimaginingvalue.ca/hearts-and-minds/) course initiated by [Max Haiven](https://maxhaiven.com/) and [Sarah Stein Lubrano](https://www.sarahsteinlubrano.com/). We'll be exploring the question _"How can we change people’s minds and create the conditions where they not only support but join the movements for radical change we desperately need?"_

I've been following Max's work for a while and am in the middle of reading [The Radical Imagination](https://maxhaiven.com/radicalimagination/#INTRO), so looking forward to a few months of guided study and reflection and conversation. I'm curious about how to learn from psychology / sociology / philosophy / critical theory and apply it to my design practice, given that a big chunk of my work is about motivating people to take political action and join movements.

#### Centre for Other Worlds
I'm really happy to share that I joined the [Centre for Other Worlds](https://otherworlds.pt/), a research centre for art and design initiated by Lusófona University in Lisbon. It's a distributed network of designers and researchers, all of whom I deeply admire. They also publish a [journal](https://buttondown.email/otherworlds) edited by Silvio Lorusso.

> We value design cultures, but we approach them without devotion. Instead of celebrating the power of design, we focus on the power structures that, willingly or not, design reproduces. For us, more than a solution, design itself is a problem and a challenge.

#### Rizoma Cooperativa
I've also joined a local cooperative, [Rizoma](https://rizomacoop.pt/en/). It's similar to Minga, which I [wrote about previously](https://gemmacope.land/writing/all-flourishing-is-mutual/), in that it's a multi-sector cooperative with five integrated strands: consumers, services, culture, agriculture and housing. It's based in Arroios with a grocery store, cafe and terrace at ground level, a co-working space upstairs and a cultural space downstairs. They also have two fledgling sector groups focused on habitation (campaigning against the housing crisis and setting up cooperative housing) and agriculture.
