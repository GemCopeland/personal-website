Alex and I recently spoke to Shane and Kyle from the [General Intellect Unit podcast](http://generalintellectunit.net/e/068-common-knowledge/).

We spoke about our work, grassroots organising, and practical details around how to start and run a worker co-op.

(I haven't actually been able to listen to it yet as listening to my own voice makes me cringe.)
