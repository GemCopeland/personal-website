I’m [@gem@social.coop](https://social.coop/@gem) on Mastodon. 

I like it much more than Twitter already! I had gotten to a point where I barely posted anything on Twitter because it was too noisy and overwhelming, and reading the feed mainly made me feel depressed about the world. There sure were some good memes though.

I found a tool called [Debirdify](https://pruvisto.org/debirdify/) that helps you find your Twitter friends on Mastodon.

This article from Wired — [How to Get Started on Mastodon](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-get-started-use-mastodon/) — is a really useful introduction.

Strong agree with what Robin Sloan [wrote about Twitter ending](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/lost-thread/) back in April:
> There are so many ways people might relate to one another online, so many ways exchange and conviviality might be organized. Look at these screens, this wash of pixels, the liquid potential! What a colossal bummer that Twitter eked out a local maximum; that its network effect still (!) consumes the fuel for other possibilities, other explorations.
