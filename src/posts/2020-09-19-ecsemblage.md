<!-- My first post!.. thanks you [Gemma Copeland](https://gemmacope.land/) and [Piper Haywood](https://piperhaywood.com/) who made the orginal template for this site, and for helping me get it started. -->
In the midst of the first London quarantine (prefacing with first is a safe bet) Evening-Class began work on a mail art inspired magazine. The skinny rag in question attempts to collage the collective's disparate interests and positions with each member producing four pages which were later pulled apart and scattered throughout the issue. My entry amounts to a semi-sensical materialist nonsense picture essay (ugh) which patchworks recent ideas on craft, death n’ ceremony. I cannot emphasise enough the effect that Phippe Nitchse’s [euphaniaisa machine](https://www.exitinternational.net/sarco/) has had on my thinking, so maybe this output can be viewed as another way of my subconscious stressing its importance. Reluctant to finish, or rather to submit my work, Michael Wallace (online anon) collected my documents and put together the layout. Thank you, Herr Wallace.
