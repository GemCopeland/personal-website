I've recently started using [Storygraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/gemcopeland) (thanks Sonia) to track the books I'm reading. It's a not-Amazon alternative to Goodreads.

When you sign up, you're asked you a series of questions about the kinds of books you like. It also analyses the mood, pace and genre of the books you read, and then recommends more books based on this. I never actually used Goodreads (I had some low-fi Arena channels for tracking books instead), so I'm really enjoying these kind of features. Apparently I mainly read "slow-paced fiction books that are reflective, informative, and adventurous".

It seems quite hard to find people you know on the platform, so follow me if you have it (@gemcopeland)!
